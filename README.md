# Movie Ratings Prediction Project

This project aims to predict IMDB ratings for movies using various machine learning models. The problem is framed as a regression task where the goal is to predict the numerical rating a movie might receive on IMDB.

## Project Steps

### 1. Defined the Problem
We clearly defined the problem: predicting the IMDB ratings of movies based on various features such as director name, duration, and other influential factors.

### 2. Gathered Data
We collected relevant data for the project. The dataset includes information about movies, such as the director's name, movie duration, genre, and other features that could potentially influence the IMDB ratings.

### 3. Explored and Understood the Data
We performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset. This step involved checking for missing values, identifying outliers, and analyzing patterns within the data.

### 4. Data Visualization
We used `seaborn` and `matplotlib` libraries to create visualizations that helped us better understand the distributions and relationships within the data.

### 5. Preprocessed the Data
Data preprocessing was performed to prepare the dataset for machine learning models. This included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and applying necessary data transformations.

### 6. Feature Engineering
We created new features to enhance the performance of the machine learning models. This step involved generating features that might capture additional insights from the data.

### 7. Split the Data
The dataset was divided into training and testing sets. The training set was used to train the models, while the testing set was reserved for evaluating model performance.

### 8. Selected a Model
We selected appropriate machine learning algorithms suitable for regression tasks. Common models considered include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting algorithms.

### 9. Trained the Model
The chosen models were trained using the training data. During this step, the models learned patterns from the data to make accurate predictions.

### 10. Tuned Hyperparameters
We optimized model performance by tuning hyperparameters. This process involved adjusting parameters that are not directly learned during the training process to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy.

### 11. Evaluated the Model
Finally, we evaluated the model's performance using the testing set. Common evaluation metrics used for regression tasks include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. These metrics provided insights into the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions.
